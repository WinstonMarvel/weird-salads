## Overview

This is a starter template using the following stack:

- Framework - [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/14)
- Language - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- Auth - [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)

This template uses the new Next.js App Router. This includes support for enhanced layouts, colocation of components, tests, and styles, component-level data fetching, and more.

## Getting Started

The env config file `.env.loval` must exist in the root directory. You can use the template present in the root directory `.env.loval.example` for the same. 

Finally, run the following commands to start the development server:

```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

You should now be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000.
